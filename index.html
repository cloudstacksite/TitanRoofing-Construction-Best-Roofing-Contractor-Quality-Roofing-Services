                <h2>Comprehensive Roofing Solutions for Your Business</h2>
                <p>
                    At Titan Roofing, we specialize in a variety of commercial roofing systems. Whether you need a new roof installed or a replacement for an old, deteriorating roof, we have the expertise to guide you through the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are some of the most popular commercial roofing options we offer:
                </p>
                <h3>1. TPO Roofing (Thermoplastic Olefin)</h3>
                <p>
                    TPO roofing is a highly popular choice for commercial buildings due to its combination of energy efficiency, durability, and cost-effectiveness. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_olefin">Thermoplastic Olefin</a> roofs reflect sunlight, which helps to lower cooling costs, and are resistant to UV rays, making them an excellent option for Arizona’s hot climate.
                </p>
                <h3>2. EPDM Roofing (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)</h3>
                <p>
                    EPDM roofing is a rubber-like membrane that is known for its outstanding durability and resistance to environmental factors. EPDM roofs are perfect for flat or low-slope commercial buildings and are especially suited for Arizona’s weather, offering long-lasting protection against UV rays, rain, and extreme temperatures. 
                </p>
                <h3>3. Metal Roofing</h3>
                <p>
                    Metal roofing offers unmatched durability, especially for commercial properties in areas prone to extreme weather. Its ability to withstand high winds, hail, and even fire makes it a top choice for businesses looking for long-term roofing solutions. Metal roofs are also a cost-effective option, as they can often be repaired and coated to extend their lifespan, saving you money on full replacements. 
                </p>
                <h3>4. Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF)</h3>
                <p>
                    SPF roofing is a highly versatile option offering superior insulation while providing a durable shield against the elements. SPF roofs are resistant to water, adaptable to various roof structures, and help increase energy efficiency in commercial buildings.
                </p>
                <h3>5. Elastomeric Coating</h3>
                <p>
                    Elastomeric coatings are a smart option for commercial roofs, especially those looking for flexibility and resilience. This coating can be applied to metal and concrete roofs to create a waterproof barrier that stretches and contracts with the movements of the building..
                </p>
                <h3>6. Shingles</h3>
                <p>
                    Shingle roofing, though traditionally associated with residential homes, is also a reliable option for commercial buildings. Asphalt shingles are particularly popular for their durability, affordability, and versatility.
                </p>
                <h3>7. Tile Roofing</h3>
                <p>
                    Tile roofing, whether made from clay or concrete, is a durable and aesthetically pleasing roofing option for commercial properties. Known for its fire and insect resistance, tile roofing offers long-term protection against the elements.
                </p>
                <h2>Additional Roofing Services</h2>

                <h3>5. Warranty Protection</h3>
